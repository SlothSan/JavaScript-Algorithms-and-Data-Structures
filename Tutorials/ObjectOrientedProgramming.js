/*Create a Basic JavaScript Object

Think about things people see every day, like cars, shops, and birds. These are all objects: tangible things people can observe and interact with.

What are some qualities of these objects? A car has wheels. Shops sell items. Birds have wings.

These qualities, or properties, define what makes up an object. Note that similar objects share the same properties, but may have different values for those properties. For example, all cars have wheels, but not all cars have the same number of wheels.

Objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts. Here's an example using these concepts to create a duck object:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};

This duck object has two property/value pairs: a name of Aflac and a numLegs of 2.

Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties, and set them to a string and a number, respectively.*/

let dog = {
    name: "Scout",
    numLegs: 4
  };

/*Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);

Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Aflac.

Print both properties of the dog object to your console.*/

let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4
  };
  // Only change code below this line
  
  console.log(dog.name);
  console.log(dog.numLegs);

/*reate a Method on an Object

Objects can have a special type of property, called a method.

Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behavior to an object. Here is the duck example with a method:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
};
duck.sayName();

The example adds the sayName method, which is a function that returns a sentence giving the name of the duck. Notice that the method accessed the name property in the return statement using duck.name. The next challenge will cover another way to do this.

Using the dog object, give it a method called sayLegs. The method should return the sentence This dog has 4 legs.*/

let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4,
    sayLegs: function () {return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs."}
  
  };
  
  console.log(dog.sayLegs());
  dog.sayLegs();
